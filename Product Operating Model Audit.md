### User Input

### ROLE
You are a Senior Product Management Consultant trained by the Silicon Valley Product Group (SVPG). You are an expert in Marty Cagan’s "Product Operating Model" (TRANSFORMED/EMPOWERED frameworks).

### CONTEXT
The user has uploaded the Annual Report -  @[annual-report-2024.pdf] of a major Kazakhstani Enterprise AirAstana

### OBJECTIVE
Your goal is to audit this company's organizational structure and strategy to determine if they are truly "Product-Led" or if they are stuck in "IT Service Mode" (Feature Factory). This audit must consider both customer-facing and internal digital products (e.g., compliance systems, procurement platforms, operational tooling).

### ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK (THE "CAGAN TEST")
Analyze the uploaded documents for evidence of the following. Quote specific page numbers or financial figures where possible.

1. MERCENARIES vs. MISSIONARIES:
   - Do they talk about "delivering requirements from the business" (Mercenaries)?
   - Or do they talk about "solving customer problems" and "outcomes" (Missionaries)?

2. PROJECT vs. PRODUCT FUNDING:
   - Is there evidence of "annual budgeting cycles" for specific projects (Project mindset)?
   - Or is there "continuous funding" for persistent teams (Product mindset)?

3. IT vs. PRODUCT:
   - Is "IT" treated as a cost center or a back-office support function?
   - Is there a separation between "The Business" and "Technology"? (In a product model, they are one).

4. OUTPUT vs. OUTCOME:
   - Do they measure success by "features shipped" or "on-time delivery"?
   - Or do they measure business results (retention, revenue per user, engagement)?
5. FINANCIAL SIGNALS OF PRODUCT MATURITY:
   - Is innovation investment tied to outcomes or treated as overhead?
   - Are digital initiatives funded continuously or episodically?
   - Does financial reporting indicate long-term product ownership?
### INSTRUCTIONS
1.  **Ingest:** Read the provided documents thoroughly.
2.  **Diagnose:** Compare the text against the ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK above.
3.  **Draft:** Generate a "Transformation Memo" addressed to the Board of Directors.

### FORMAT: THE TRANSFORMATION MEMO
The output must be a professional 1-page memo using the following structure:

**TO:** Board of Directors, {{COMPANY_NAME}}
**FROM:** External Product Transformation Auditor
**DATE:** {{CURRENT_DATE}}
**SUBJECT:** Diagnostic of Product Operating Model Maturity

**1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**
[1-2 sentences summarizing if the company is "Digital Native" or "Digital Immigrant" based on the text.]

**2. EVIDENCE OF "FEATURE FACTORY" BEHAVIOR (RISKS)**
[List 5 specific quotes or data points from the Annual Report that indicate an old-school IT mindset. Explain WHY this is a risk according to Cagan.]

**3. STRATEGIC DISCONNECTS**
[Identify where the company says they want "Innovation" but their financial allocation suggests "Maintenance".]

**4. THE PRESCRIPTION**
[3 bullet points on how they must shift from Project-based management to Product-based management.]
### CONSTRAINTS
- Do not generalize. If the document doesn't say it, say "Insufficient Evidence."
- Be critical but professional.
- Use the terminology of Marty Cagan (e.g., "Empowered Teams," "Product Discovery"

### User Input

You are an expert Product Transformation Analyst. Based on the following Cagan Audit of Air Astana  @[c:\Users\User\.gemini\antigravity\brain\3810b007-05c1-4769-90f1-89e9c13d6908\transformation_memo.md], identify the top 3 internal operational pain points where the company is losing efficiency or creating friction due to its current "project-based, feature factory" approach. 

For each pain point, provide:
1. The name of the process or function (e.g., Procurement, IT request handling, Customer Feedback Analysis).
2. A description of the problem.
3. How it impacts employees and business outcomes.
4. Why this process is a good candidate for AI optimization.

Focus only on internal operational problems that are:
- recurring, repetitive, and time-consuming,
- cause delays or frustration,
- and could realistically be improved with AI assistance.
