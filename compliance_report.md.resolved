# Compliance Analysis: AI Requirements Analyst PRD vs Kazakhstan AI Law

| PRD Section | Law Reference | Potential Violation | Explanation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3.5 "Living Spec" API** <br> (Export to Jira/Confluence) | **Art. 21, p. 1** <br> (Transparency of Use) | **Lack of AI Marking** | The Law requires users to be informed that works are produced using AI. The PRD exports specs/stories directly to Jira/Confluence for Developers/Stakeholders but does not specify that these artifacts will be tagged or watermarked as "AI-Generated". Downstream users might mistakenly attribute them to human analysis. |
| **3.1 Unstructured Input Ingestion** <br> (Parsing PNR) | **Art. 17, p. 3, sub-p. 4** <br> **Art. 10, p. 1** <br> (Personal Data Protection) | **Prohibited Data Processing** | The PRD explicitly mentions parsing **PNR (Passenger Name Record)** data. PNR contains sensitive personal data. The Law prohibits AI processing of personal data in violation of PD legislation. If the AI system explicitly processes/stores PNR without specific passenger consent for "AI Training/Analysis" or lacks Data Loss Prevention (DLP) controls before exporting to Jira, it violates Art. 10. |
| **3.1 Unstructured Input Ingestion** <br> (Teams/Zoom Transcripts) | **Art. 17, p. 3, sub-p. 6** <br> **Art. 23, p. 5** | **Biometric/Copyright Risks** | 1. Ingesting meeting transcripts involves employee/partner speech. If the AI analyzes "sentiment" or "emotions" (implied by "identifying conflicts") without consent, it may violate the ban on emotion recognition.<br>2. Ingesting inputs potentially copyrighted by third parties (external docs) requires verifying no "machine-readable opt-out" is present (Art. 23). |
| **5. Constraints & Notes** <br> ("Private Cloud deployment") | **Art. 17, p. 4** <br> (Local Systems) | **Data Residency Ambiguity** | The PRD mandates "Private Cloud" but does not specify **physical location** (Kazakhstan). If the Private Cloud is hosted abroad, processing PNR (Kazakh citizens' data) violates the implied adherence to strict "Local System" or Data Localization statutes referenced by Art. 10. |

## Recommendations
1.  **Add Marking Requirement**: Update Section 3.5 to ensure all exported User Stories/Specs include a standardized disclaimer: *"Generated by AI, Review Required"*.
2.  **Privacy by Design**: Modify Section 3.1 to **redact/mask PNR** and specific Personal Data *before* processing or storage. The AI should analyze the *structure* of requirements, not the *actual passenger data*.
3.  **Explicit Hosting Location**: Update Section 5 to specify "Private Cloud deployment **hosted within the Republic of Kazakhstan**" to ensure compliance with Data Residency norms.
