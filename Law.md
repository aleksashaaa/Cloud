### User Input

You are an expert in AI governance and legal compliance. I will provide you with two documents:

1. Kazakhstan AI Law: @[Cloud/z2500000230.17-11-2025.rus (2).docx] 
2. AI Requirements Analyst PRD for Air Astana: @[c:\Users\User\.gemini\antigravity\brain\647574fd-9b93-479a-b9f2-57c2f326a8f8\ai_requirements_analyst_prd.md.resolved] 

Your task:

1. Analyze the PRD in the context of the Kazakhstan AI law. Identify any points where the PRD might **violate legal requirements**, including but not limited to:

   - Data residency / cross-border data transfer rules  
   - Human-in-the-loop requirements  
   - Transparency of AI decision-making  
   - Use of personal or sensitive data  
   - Any prohibited AI use cases in Kazakhstan

2. For each potential violation, provide:  
   - The section of the PRD involved  
   - The relevant law article / requirement  
   - Explanation of how it could be a violation

3. If there are **no violations**, explicitly say so.

Output:

- Structured, concise table format preferred:  
  | PRD Section | Law Reference | Potential Violation | Explanation |

Be critical and precise. Focus only on compliance, do not comment on business value or ROI.
