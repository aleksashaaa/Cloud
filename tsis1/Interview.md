Why does the current process prevent you from focusing on solving real business problems?

Why would automating part of this process help you deliver value faster?


### Planner Response

As **Nurzhan**, I’m staring at my screen, scrolling through yet another 40-page Business Requirement Document (BRD) while my coffee goes cold. Here is the reality of my day-to-day at Air Astana:

***

### Why do you spend so much time preparing requirements documents?

Because I’m trying to hit a moving target with a stone tablet. Every stakeholder—from Marketing wanting "flashy" to Ops needing "robust safety compliance"—speaks a different language. I spend weeks untangling email chains, translating vague requests like "improve the booking flow" into hundreds of specific functional requirements. If I miss one edge case in the documentation now, I know I’ll be blamed for it three months later during UAT (User Acceptance Testing). So, I over-document everything to cover my back, formatting and re-formatting text that I suspect half the people won’t even read.

### Why do details often get lost when requirements move to IT?

Because we are playing a game of "telephone" with PDF files. I write the requirements based on business needs, but once I hand that document over, it enters a black box. The developers aren't sitting in the room when the Commercial Director explains *why* a feature matters for revenue; they just see a Jira ticket saying "Add field X to form Y." The nuance—the "why"—is stripped away, leaving only the "what." By the time IT picks it up, the original context is buried under weeks of approval workflows, and they build exactly what I wrote, which isn't always exactly what the business needed.

### Why do developers misunderstand the requirements?

It is rarely their fault; it’s the format. I’m forced to describe dynamic, real-time user expereinces using static text and screenshots. I write "The system should alert the user," but a developer reads that and thinks "browser pop-up," while I meant "email notification." Terms like "user-friendly" or "fast" mean nothing in code. Unless I define "fast" as "under 200ms load time," they might build a robust backend that takes three seconds to load, thinking they did a great job. We are speaking different dialects of the same language, and the document doesn't translate for us.

### Why can’t these issues be solved by better templates or meetings?

A better template is just a prettier cage. It doesn't solve the core issue that requirements are complex and interconnected. You can’t "template" your way out of ambiguity. As for meetings? We have too many already. We spend hours constantly re-explaining the same logic to different people. We have the "kick-off," then the "alignment check," then the "clarification call." But meetings are ephemeral; people forget, or they weren't paying attention. Two weeks later, the developer is coding at 2 AM and looks at the document, not their memory of a meeting from Tuesday.

### Why does the current process prevent you from focusing on solving real business problems?

I am a glorified scribe right now. I was hired to analyze business data, spot trends in passenger behavior, and optimize our routes or pricing strategies. Instead, I spend 80% of my time formatting Word documents, chasing signatures, and arguing over wording in a table. I’m managing the *process* of building software, not the *value* of the software. Every hour I spend aligning margins in a BRD is an hour I’m not looking at how we can better serve our passengers or cut operational costs.

### Why would automating part of this process help you deliver value faster?

If an AI or tool could instantly turn my messy meeting notes and email threads into a structured, standardized draft, I could skip the "grunt work" and go straight to the meaningful analysis. I want to spend my time validating *if* a requirement makes sense for the business, not typing it out. If I could automate the translation of "business speak" into "developer specs," we would cut out the ambiguity. It wouldn't just save time; it would let me act as a bridge between strategy and execution, rather than a barrier of paperwork. I want to be an architect, but right now, I'm just laying bricks.
