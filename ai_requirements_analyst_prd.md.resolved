## 1. Job to be Done (JTBD)

**User Persona:** Nurzhan, Requirements Analyst at Air Astana.
**Situation:** Facing tight deadlines with complex stakeholder inputs (email threads, meeting notes, legacy docs) while needing to produce precise technical specifications for IT.
**Core Motivation:** "I want to stop being a glorified scribe formatting documents and start being a strategic analyst."

> **JTBD Statement:**
> "When **I have scattered requirements from multiple business stakeholders**, I want to **instantly transform them into structured, unambiguous developer specifications**, so that **I can eliminate weeks of documentation 'grunt work' and prevent costly misunderstandings during development.**"

## 2. Problem Summary

Air Astana’s product delivery is bottlenecked by the "Translation Gap" between Business and IT.

1.  **Documentation Overhead:** Analysts spend ~80% of time on formatting and compilation rather than analysis.
2.  **Context Loss:** The "Why" (Business Value) is stripped away during the conversion to the "What" (Technical Spec), leading to mercenary-style execution.
3.  **Ambiguity:** Natural language requirements ("make it fast") are misinterpreted by developers ("optimized backend but slow UI"), causing rework.
4.  **Static Handoffs:** reliance on static PDFs/Docs means specifications are dead on arrival and prone to version control issues.

## 3. Functional Requirements for the AI Agent

The AI Agent acts as an intelligent middleware between Business Input and Technical Output.

### 3.1 Unstructured Input Ingestion
*   **Description:** The agent must accept raw inputs in various formats without requiring manual pre-structuring.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   Ingest email threads, meeting transcripts (Teams/Zoom), and raw notes.
    *   Parse highly technical airline domain acronyms (e.g., PNR, DCS, SSR).
    *   Identify conflicting requirements across different input sources.

### 3.2 "The Ambiguity Hunter" (Clarification Engine)
*   **Description:** Before finalizing specs, the agent actively identifies vague terms and prompts the analyst for definition.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   Detects relative terms (e.g., "fast", "user-friendly", "robust") and prompts for quantifiable metrics (e.g., " < 200ms", "Zero downtime during deployment").
    *   Flags missing edge cases (e.g., "What happens if the flight is cancelled?").

### 3.3 Automated User Story Generation
*   **Description:** Converts consolidated requirements into standard Agile User Stories with Acceptance Criteria.
*   **Output Format:**
    *   **User Story:** `As a [Persona], I want [Action], so that [Benefit].`
    *   **Acceptance Criteria:** Gherkin syntax (`Given/When/Then`) or checklist format.
*   **Value Add:** Automatically links the "So that [Benefit]" back to the strategic business goal, preserving context.

### 3.4 Bi-Directional Translation Layer
*   **Description:** Generates two distinct views on the same data set.
    *   **Business View:** Focuses on ROI, UX flow, and timeline.
    *   **Developer View:** Focuses on API constraints, data fields, and edge cases.
*   **Goal:** Ensures Marketing and IT agree on the *product* even if they read different *documents*.

### 3.5 "Living Spec" API
*   **Description:** The requirements should not just be a static text file.
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   Export to Jira/Confluence/Azure DevOps automatically.
    *   Versioning: "If I change this requirement, what other stories break?" (Change Impact Analysis).

## 4. Expected Outcomes (Success Metrics)

| Metric | Target Impact |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cycle Time (Concept to Ready-for-Dev)** | Reduce from **3 weeks** to **3 days** |
| **Rework Rate** | Decrease rework due to "misunderstood requirements" by **50%** |
| **Analyst Satisfaction** | Nurzhan spends **>50%** of time on Analysis (vs. formatting) |
| **Defect Density** | Reduced ambiguous logic bugs in UAT |

---

## 5. Constraints & Notes

*   **Human-in-the-Loop:** The AI is a **copilot**, not an autopilot. Nurzhan must review and approve all generated specifications. The AI does not make business decisions.
*   **Security:** Data must not leave Air Astana’s secure tenancy (Private Cloud deployment required).
*   **Organizational Limits:** The AI can optimize the *handoff*, but it cannot fix broken organizational reporting lines or lack of product strategy (Project vs Product funding model).
